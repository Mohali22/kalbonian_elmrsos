##### practice on variables and data types #####
#----------------------------------------------#

# What are the variables #
# ---------------------- #
# We use variables to save data in memory, to be used in our program
# The variable is created by typing the variable name, and then marks an equal, and then typing the value for this variable


# example
name = "Mohamed ali"


# What is allowed to write the variable name? #
# ------------------------------------------- #

# 1- Allowed by typing numbers to the variable name, but at the end of the variable name and not at the beginning of the variable name.

# example
name1 = "This is a name for variable"


# 2- When you type a two-part variable name, you must separate them by typing this mark ( - )

# example
my_age = 34


# Not allowed to write the variable name #
# -------------------------------------- #

# 1-
