# 1- this code print the string (challeng 1:)
print("Challenge 1:")


# 2- create two variables the same name (message & Message)
# but python case sensitive, Here there is a difference between the variables

# A message for the user
message = "This is going to be tricky ;)"
Message = "Very tricky!"


# 3- this code print the variable => message,  contain a string ("This is going to be tricky ;")
print(message)  # show the message on the screen


# 4- here create a variable named => result, the value for this variable is two power three

# Perform mathematical operations
result = 2**3


# 5- this code print a string contain => ("2**3 =") and value of result variable is 8
print("2**3 =", result)


# 6- here a new value has been set to the variable => result
result = 5 - 3


# 7- this code print a string contain => ("5 - 3 =") and a new value of result variable is 2
# <<<<< BUT THIS CODE IS NOT WORKING BECAUSE OF COMMENT ON THE CODE >>>>>

#print("5 - 3 =", result)


# 8- this code print the string (Challenge complete!)
print("Challenge complete!")
