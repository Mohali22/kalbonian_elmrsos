##### Chapter Summary (variables and data types) #####
#----------------------------------------------------#

# What are the variables #
# ---------------------- #
# We use variables to save data in memory, to be used in our program
# The variable is created by typing the variable name, and then marks an equal, and then typing the value for this variable


# example
name = "Mohamed ali"


# What is allowed to write the variable name? #
# ------------------------------------------- #

# 1- Allowed by typing numbers to the variable name, but at the end of the variable name and not at the beginning of the variable name.

# example
name1 = "This is a name for variable"


# 2- When you type a two-part variable name, you must separate them by typing this mark ( - )

# example
my_age = 34


# Not allowed to write the variable name #
# -------------------------------------- #

# 1- The variable name is not allowed with an empty space between words

# example
my age = 34  # This is invalid


# 2- Python's keywords are not allowed to names for variables, such as ==> ( if | else )

# example
if = 34  # This is invalid


# 3- The numbers can not be used at the beginning of the variable name

# example
1name = "Mohamed ali"  # This is invalid


# Noticeable #
# ---------- #

# Python is case sensitive
# The variable name in large characters is not the same as small characters
# ==> ( Age = 34 | age = 34 )
# Python is dynamic language
# we don't need to declare a variable's type before using it. Here, we declare the variable and use it at the same time.
# The Python interpreter able to figure out the type
# In some programming languages when you define the variable, you must specify the data type of this variable, these languages are called strict languages such as ( C | C# | C++ )


# Numbers in Python #
# ----------------- #

# There are two types of numbers
# Integer numbers such as ==> ( 1 | 5 | 20 | 70 )
# Floating numbers such as ==> ( 1.5 | 5.10 | 20.6 | 70.9 )


# Arithmetic operators #
# -------------------- #

# 1- ( + )
# 2- ( - )
# 3- ( * )
# 4- ( / )
# 5- ( % )
# 6- ( ** )


# Strings in Python #
# ----------------- #

# The strings are characters, numbers and spaces using the strings in writing a word or text sentence
# The strings are written between the single quote mark or a double quote mark such as => ( "String here" | 'String here' )

# example
name = "Mohamed ali"

# OR

name = 'Mohamed ali'


# The strings can not be written without single quote mark or a double quote mark
