##### Chapter Summary ( requirements ) #####
# ---------------------------------------- #


# Defining requirements #
# --------------------- #

# It is knowing the main requirements from the client and a comprehensive description of what he wants the application to provide
# 1- What does the application provide?
# 2- What problem does the app solve?
# 3- The purpose of creating the application

# You should focus only on the basic requirements and not on how to implement them.
# The advantages provided by the application are determined


# FURPS+ requirements #
# ------------------- #

# what is FURPS?
# One commonly used model for classifying software quality attributes is the acronym FURPS which stands for functionality,
# usability, reliability, performance and supportability.
# FURPS serves as a checklist of several key qualities to consider when determining requirements.

# F – Functionality – Describes the main operational functions or requirements of the system or release. What is it going to do for the user?

# U – Usability – Defines its aesthetics and accessibility, how the human and machine interfaces are accessed and laid out. How do other systems, processes or human users interact and use the new system?

# R – Reliability – Details the reliability, robustness and fault tolerance of the system, which will generally have a considerable bearing on its cost and the resources required to develop it. How critically important is the system availability?

# P – Performance – Is the level of performance and efficiency. Here speed, power consumption capacity and scalability are all important factors which will each have a bearing on both the development and operational costs. How quickly is the new system required to respond to a request and to what level of accuracy?

# S – Supportability – Discusses the maintainability of the system, its modularity and how easily it may be upgraded enhanced and repaired. How frequently will components require upgrading, how much down-time may be tolerated for routine maintenance and repairs?
