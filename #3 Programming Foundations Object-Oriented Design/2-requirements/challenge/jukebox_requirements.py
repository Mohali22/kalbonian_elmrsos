##### Challenge ( jukebox requirements ) #####
# ------------------------------------------ #

# I use FURPS as a guide
# The first thing is to define the functional requirements
# The second thing is to determine the usability of the system

# functional requirements #
# ----------------------- #

# What should the system do?
# [1] - The system must contain a music library of albums and songs, allowing users to browse those albums and songs.
# [2] - The system should allow the user to sort by artist.
# [3] - identify individual users
# [4] - track number of plays per user

# usability requirements #
# ---------------------- #
# [1] - intuitive to use while floating space
# [2] - available 24/7
# [3] - low-pawer
