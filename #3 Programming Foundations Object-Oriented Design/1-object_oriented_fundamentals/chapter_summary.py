# Differences between Procedural and OOP #
# ========================================

# 1- What is Procedural Programming?
# Procedural Programming may be the first programming paradigm that a new developer will learn.
# Fundamentally, the procedural code is the one that directly instructs a device on how to finish a task in logical steps.
# This paradigm uses a linear top-down approach and treats data and procedures as two different entities.
# Based on the concept of a procedure call, Procedural Programming divides the program into procedures,
# which are also known as routines or functions, simply containing a series of steps to be carried out.
# Simply put, Procedural Programming involves writing down a list of instructions to tell the computer what it should do step-by-step to finish the task at hand.

# What is Object Oriented Programming?
# Object oriented programming can be defined as a programming model which is based upon the concept of objects.
# Objects contain data in the form of attributes and code in the form of methods.
# In object oriented programming, computer programs are designed using the concept of objects that interact with real world.
# Object oriented programming languages are various but the most popular ones are class-based,
# meaning that objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types.


# What are the advantages of object-oriented programming #
# ====================================================== #

# 1- Re-usability
# 2- Data Redundancy
# 3- Code Maintenance
# 4- Better productivity
# 5- Easy troubleshooting
