##### Chapter Summary ( iteration ) #####
# ------------------------------------- #

# Introduction to iteration #
# ------------------------- #

# 1- what is iteration
# In Python, the iterative statements are also known as looping statements or repetitive statements.
# The iterative statements are used to execute a part of the program repeatedly as long as a given condition is True.

# 2- To write code that iterates,
# you commonly need a few specific pieces of information.
# First, you need to specify the data that's being iterated.
# Second, you need to describe what should happen to the data on each iteration
# Finally, you need to indicate when the loop should stop
# a bug that can occur when the ending condition is omitted or specified incorrectly
# This creates a situation where the loop never stops
# which may result in a program that freezes or stops responding, as well as heavy demand on the computer running the program,
# which could slow it down or cause it to heat up.


# Iterating through collections #
# ----------------------------- #

# Using for loops with lists or other collections allows us to work with sets of data without writing repetitive code
# For loops are typically used when the number of iterations is known before entering the loop
