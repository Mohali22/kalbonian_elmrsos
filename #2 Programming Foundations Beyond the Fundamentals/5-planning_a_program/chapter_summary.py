# Choosing a code style #
# --------------------- #

# A programming style is a set of guidelines used to format programming instructions.
# It is useful to follow a style as it makes it easier for programmers to understand the code,
# maintain it, and assists in reducing the likelihood of introducing errors.
# Guidelines can be developed from coding conventions used in an organization with variations of style occurring for different programming languages.
# Key elements of the programming style guide include naming conventions, use of comments, and formatting (indenting, white spaces).
# For Python developers, the most commonly used style guide is called PEP 8, which is short for Python Enhancement Proposal Number 8.
# As I write Python code, PEP 8 even covers some of the very basics of coding. For instance, Python relies on indentation to indicate the content of structures like conditionals and functions
# whilst in other languages indenting is used to improve the visible appearance and readability of the code


# Writing pseudocode #
# ------------------ #

# What is Pseudocode
# Pseudocode literally means ‘fake code’.
# It is an informal and contrived way of writing programs in which you represent the sequence of actions and instructions (aka algorithms) in a form that humans can easily understand.
# Pseudocode also frees you from having to decide on a specific syntax to use or even a specific language.
# Instead, you simply describe what you need to accomplish.
# When your pseudocode is done, you're left with an outline for your program, which you can then built out using a programming language.
